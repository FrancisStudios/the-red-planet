# FSCanvasEngine ‚öôÔ∏è

FSCE is written in **Javascript** and is running in **electron** allowing to create cross platform desktop games. It's a simplisic game engine that allows users to create 2D games (side-scrolling, top-down, isometric, point-n-click) easily, and focus more on the gameplay than the technical implementation.

**IMPORTANT: FSCE Editor is coming soon, where you can build a game with a GUI, no coding skills or anything required**
